It represents not only a creative exploration but also a foundational step in my evolution as a designer. <br /><br /> Conceptualizing the integration of an indoor yard within a café setting challenged me to think innovatively and push the boundaries of traditional design norms <br /><br /> In my university years, this café interior project marked a significant milestone in my design education. It provided a platform for me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and hone my practical skills in interior design. <br /><br /> As one of my first major projects, it taught me invaluable lessons in project management, time allocation, and teamwork. Through research, experimentation, and feedback, I gained a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of design and its impact on individuals and communities. <br /><br /> Reflecting on this project now, I am grateful for the opportunities it provided for growth and learning. It instilled in me a sense of confidence and enthusiasm to pursue my passion for interior design with zeal and dedication. Looking ahead, I carry the lessons learned from this project as I continue to embark on new design endeavors and contribute to shaping inspiring spaces for the future",

It emphasized the importance of considering human factors, building codes, and sustainability principles in the planning process. <br /><br /> Students were tasked with assessing real-world scenarios, identifying spatial requirements, and proposing innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and usability of the designated spaces. Emphasis was placed on developing critical thinking skills, spatial awareness, and the ability to communicate design intentions effectively. <br /><br /> By engaging in hands-on exercises, collaborative discussions, and design critiques, participants gained practical experience in space planning methodologies and honed their problem-solving abilities. <br /><br /> Overall, the space planning project provided students with a solid foundation in the fundamentals of spatial design, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex design challenges and create environments that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",

My process began with a visual analysis of the film’s cinematography, focusing on its warm, saturated greens, deep reds, and golden tones.

The technical drawings show how I used simple, circular lines to make the furniture feel inviting and well-balanced for an outdoor space.To make sure the proportions and 'flow' of the set worked in real life, I built a physical mockup at a1:10 scale. This helped me test the circular shapes and ensure the set felt balanced and comfortable before finalizing the 3D renders.",

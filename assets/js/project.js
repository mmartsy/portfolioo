      "For my bachelor&#39;s degree project, I chose to design a meditation center nestled near the serene Kakhisi Lake in the breathtaking landscapes of Georgia. Drawing inspiration from the tranquil surroundings, my vision is to create a space that harmonizes with nature and fosters deep contemplation and inner peace. Through mindful architectural elements, sustainable materials, and an integration of the natural environment, the center will offer a serene sanctuary for individuals seeking spiritual solace and introspection amidst the beauty of Kakhisi Lake. <br /> <br /> Within this project, the focal point is a magnificent meditation hall, designed to inspire serenity and inner reflection. Adjacent to it, lies a yoga studio, where individuals can find balance and harmony through physical practice. Additionally, there&#39;s a luxurious spa and rejuvenating sauna, offering spaces for relaxation and holistic well-being.  <br /> <br /> Nestled amidst the lush landscape are healing pools, providing a tranquil setting for renewal and restoration. For moments of communal enjoyment, there&#39;s an outdoor cinema under the starry skies, where visitors can gather and connect with nature in a unique way. With these diverse amenities and more, the meditation center near Kakhisi Lake promises a holistic sanctuary for mind, body, and soul.",

It provided a platform for me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and hone my practical skills in interior design. <br /><br /> As one of my first major projects, it taught me invaluable lessons in project management, time allocation, and teamwork. Through research, experimentation, and feedback, I gained a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of design and its impact on individuals and communities. <br /><br /> Reflecting on this project now, I am grateful for the opportunities it provided for growth and learning. It instilled in me a sense of confidence and enthusiasm to pursue my passion for interior design with zeal and dedication. Looking ahead, I carry the lessons learned from this project as I continue to embark on new design endeavors and contribute to shaping inspiring spaces for the future",
